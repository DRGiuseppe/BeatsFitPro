                <p class="Paragraph"><span class="Beats">Beats Fit Pro</span> is engineered to deliver powerful, 
                balanced sound via a custom acoustic platform that stays with you through your daily activities.
                A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing,
                resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor 
                that optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise cancellation.</p>
                <p class="Paragraph"><span class="Beats">Beats Fit Pro</span> supports Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for immersive music, 
                movies and games. Dynamic head tracking uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to adjust the sound as you turn your head, for a multi-dimensional 
                experience that makes you feel like you are inside of it.</p>
                <p class="Paragraph"><span class="Beats">Hear what matters</span>, with two distinct listening modes you are in control of what you hear. 
                Fully adaptive Active Noise Cancelling uses real-time audio calibration to continuously avoid unwanted external sounds and optimize sound output. 
                When you need to be aware of your surroundings, easily switch to Transparency mode. The external-facing microphones capture environmental and ambient sound around you to mix in with your music. 
                Now, you can always choose the listening mode that fits your needs.</p>
